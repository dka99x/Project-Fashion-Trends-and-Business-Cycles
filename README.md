        The project explores the intricate relationship between fashion trends, business cycles, and international trade. 
        Through meticulous analysis, it investigates how shifts in clothing materials, the emergence and decline of fashion houses, 
        and global economic events influence one another. By examining historical data and current trends, the study aims to uncover 
        patterns that elucidate why fashion trends are cyclical and how they reflect broader economic dynamics. Its ultimate goal is 
        to develop a predictive model that forecasts upcoming business cycle trends based on changes in fashion preferences.
